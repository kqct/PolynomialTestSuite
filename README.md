A collection of polynomial tests from the original assignment, my own tests, and the Megatester. 
These tests require JUnit 5 to run.

Feel free to add your own test cases! If you want, you can submit a pull request and I'll probably add your cases too.

### If you are using Sasha's SpeedTester program:
Please change the relevant line in `build.gradle` to the location and name of the `RuntimeTester.jar` file.

## Installation
### IntelliJ
To import the project from version control:
1. Click "Get from version control..."
2. Select "GitHub"
3. Select a local directory and paste the URL of this project
4. You're done!

### Eclipse
1. Select "Git -> Projects from Git (with smart import)"
2. Select "Clone URI"
3. Paste the URL of this project into "URI"
4. Select the "master" branch

This still doesn't work. If anyone knows how importing Gradle projects into Eclipse works please feel free to open an issue/pull request to tell me.

## Usage

Right-click on the package "src/test/java/assignment2" and click "Run 'Tests in 'assignment2''"
