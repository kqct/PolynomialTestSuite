A collection of polynomial tests from the original assignment, my own tests, and the Megatester. 
These tests require JUnit 5 to run.

Feel free to add your own test cases! If you want, you can submit a pull request and I'll probably add your cases too.

### If you are using Sasha's SpeedTester program:
Please change the relevant line in `build.gradle` to the location and name of the `RuntimeTester.jar` file.
